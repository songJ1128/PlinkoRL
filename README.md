# Plinko Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview

This project combines plinko and reinforcement learning using q learning. The objective is for the agent to learn the bet strategy for choosing the drop position that makes the most money.

## Features

- **Q-Network:** uses a neural network to calculate q values for the different drop positions.
- **Epsilon Greedy Strategy:** balances between exploration and exploitation during training.
